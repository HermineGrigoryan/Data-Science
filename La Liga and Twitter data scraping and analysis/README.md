## Objective

In this group homework we used Web scraping techqniques (Web Scraping and APIs) to scrap data from
different websites and work on it. The project consists of two parts.

The first part includes web scraping, data cleaning and quantitative analysis of 2016-2017 and 2017-2018
**La Liga** football statistics. In the analysis, we provide some plots to visualize numbers and get interesting
insights from them. The codes for data scraping and cleaning are provided in a separate R script file. 
The final output can be found in the file called `Main_file.pdf`.

The second part of the project includes text mining. The data was scraped from Twitter. It contains
information about reactions of Twitter users about trailers of movies **Aquaman** and **Fantastic Beasts**. Warner
Bros. revealed the trailers of these movies on 21 of July, 2018, and this topic became very popular that day.
The analysis includes some graphs and wordclouds about common words used by the users. Moreover, it
includes sentiment analysis of the tweets.
