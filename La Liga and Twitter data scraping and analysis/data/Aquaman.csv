41," What about Aquaman???"
42," I love Marvel movies, but I really really want DC to do well. Justice League was not as good as, say Infinity War, but it's far better than BvS was. I don't want to hate them, I love DC heroes. I am very optimistic for Aquaman, and I hope this makes people take Aquaman seriously."

Pleasant surprise. Looks hilarious!
